Important Points about class and object:

The word “Class” came from simula language.

Class is blueprint for an entity.
In class there are variables and methods.
The access modifiers like public, private and protected used in different situation.
Objects represent the state and behavior of class.
Object is just a memory area or a buffer in heap area(memory) in which all the instance data members are getting a memory.
In Java “new” operator is only used for allocating a memory for an object only.
Memory associated with object is automatically collected by garbage collector.
Class with main method having static keyword is mandatory to call upon the object of other classes.
All the objects are sharing a same memory location for each static data members.

1. A class is a user-defined data type whereas an object is an instance of class data type.
2. A class generates objects whereas an object gives life to a class.
3. Classes do not occupy memory location but objects occupy memory location.
4. Classes cannot be manipulated due to not available in the memory location but objects can be manipulated.


1. Objects, classes, data abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, method overriding, polymorphism, and message passing are the fundamental terms and concepts to understand the concepts of object-oriented programming approach.

2. Objects are the basic runtime entities in object-oriented systems.
3. All objects in a system take a separate memory space independently of each other.
4. A class in OOPs represents a group of similar objects.

5. Once a class has been created, any number of objects belonging to that class can be created.
6. An object of a class is also known as an instance.
7. A class never represents an object, rather it represents data and actions that an object will have.
8. Members of a class consist of variables (data members) and methods (member functions).
